Martellus Bennett rests Friday, expected to play vs. Bills

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- While New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett was held out of Friday's practice with an ankle injury, it is not expected to affect his availability for Sunday's road game against the Buffalo Bills.

The team travels to Western New York later on Saturday and Bennett, barring an unexpected turn of events, will be with the club.

Bennett's absence from practice came three days after the Patriots traded No. 3 tight end AJ Derby to the Denver Broncos for a fifth-round draft choice, highlighting the team's lack of depth at the position. The possibility of entering the game with one tight end would have limited the personnel packages the Patriots could have played. Also, the team has run 96 plays with two or more tight ends from Weeks 5-7, which is the most in the NFL over that span.

More than anything, Bennett's absence from practice Friday appears to fall into the category of standard maintenance so he can be at his best against the Bills.
